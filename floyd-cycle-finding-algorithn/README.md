Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm, is an efficient algorithm for detecting cycles in a sequence of values, such as a linked list. It uses two pointers, typically called the slow pointer (tortoise) and the fast pointer (hare), to traverse the sequence at different speeds.

The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end of the sequence.
If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" or meet the slow pointer within the cycle.

## How It Works

1. Initialization: Two pointers are initialized:

- The slow pointer (tortoise) moves one step at a time.
- The fast pointer (hare) moves two steps at a time.

2. Traversal: The algorithm iterates through the sequence:

- Move the slow pointer one step.
- Move the fast pointer two steps.

3. Cycle Detection:

- If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.
- If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.

4. Finding the Start of the Cycle (if needed):

- After detecting a cycle, reset one pointer to the start of the list while keeping the other pointer at the meeting point.
- Move both pointers one step at a time; the point at which they meet again is the start of the cycle.

# Pseudocode

```
function hasCycle(head):
    if head is null:
        return false

    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:
            return true  // Cycle detected

    return false  // No cycle

```

## Implementation in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class LinkedListCycle {

    // Function to detect a cycle in the linked list
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return false;
        }

        ListNode slow = head; // Tortoise
        ListNode fast = head; // Hare

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;          // Move slow pointer one step
            fast = fast.next.next;     // Move fast pointer two steps

            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedListCycle cycleDetector = new LinkedListCycle();


        ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
        ListNode node2 = new ListNode(2);
        ListNode node3 = new ListNode(3);
        ListNode node4 = new ListNode(4);
        ListNode node5 = new ListNode(5);

        head.next = node2;
        node2.next = node3;
        node3.next = node4;
        node4.next = node5;
        node5.next = node2; // Creating a cycle


        if (cycleDetector.hasCycle(head)) {
            System.out.println("The linked list has a cycle.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The linked list does not have a cycle.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity

- Best Case: `O(1)` (when the list is empty or has one node without a cycle)
- Average Case:`O(n) `(linear traversal, dominated by the need to check for cycles)
- Worst Case: `O(n)` (when a cycle exists, and all nodes are traversed before detection)
- Space Complexity: `O(1)` (constant space usage for the pointers)

Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm has several advantages and specific use cases that make it particularly useful in computer science and software engineering. Hereâ€™s a summary of its key advantages and typical use cases:

### Advantages

1. **Space Efficiency**:

   - **Constant Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses only a fixed number of pointers (two), regardless of the size of the input. This is beneficial when working in environments where memory usage is a concern.

2. **Simplicity**:

   - **Easy to Implement**: The algorithm is straightforward to understand and implement, making it accessible for programmers at all levels.

3. **Fast Detection**:

   - **Linear Time Complexity**: It can detect cycles in O(n) time, which is efficient for linked lists and similar data structures.

4. **No Modification Needed**:
   - **Non-invasive**: The algorithm does not require modification of the linked list, making it safe for use in applications where the integrity of the data structure must be maintained.

### Use Cases

1. **Detecting Cycles in Linked Lists**:

   - The primary application is in detecting cycles in linked lists, which can prevent infinite loops in algorithms that traverse lists. For example, when implementing data structures like singly or doubly linked lists.

2. **Graph Algorithms**:

   - It can be used in cycle detection within directed and undirected graphs, particularly when the graph can be represented as a linked list or adjacency list.

3. **Memory Management**:

   - In garbage collection algorithms, Floyd's Cycle detection can help identify cyclic references, where two or more objects reference each other, preventing them from being collected.

4. **Game Development**:

   - In game loops, cycle detection can prevent infinite loops due to erroneous pathfinding or state management, ensuring the game runs smoothly.

5. **Software Development**:

   - It can be used in the detection of cycles in state machines, where states may loop back on themselves under certain conditions, helping to validate the correctness of the state transitions.

6. **Networking**:
   - Cycle detection can be useful in routing algorithms to prevent routing loops in networks, ensuring efficient data transmission.
