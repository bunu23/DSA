Introduction to Data Structures

Data Structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are crucial for designing efficient algorithms and solving complex problems.

Why Data Structures?

1. Efficiency: They help optimize performance for different operations (e.g., searching, sorting, inserting).
2. Organization: They provide ways to structure data in a meaningful way.
3. Abstraction: They allow developers to work with data in a more abstract way, focusing on what operations can be performed rather than how they are implemented.

Types of Data Structures:

1. Linear Data Structures

In linear data structures, elements are arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element. They allow traversal in a single level of hierarchy.

Examples Arrays, Linked List, Stacks, Queues

2. Non-Linear Data Structures

In non-linear data structures, elements are not arranged sequentially. They are organized in a hierarchical manner or in a graph structure, allowing more complex relationships between elements.

Example Trees, Graph
