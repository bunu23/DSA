## Singly Linked List

### What is a Singly Linked List?

A singly linked list is a data structure used for storing a sequence of nodes, where each node contains:

1. **Data** (the actual value stored).
2. **Reference to the next node** in the list.

### How Does a Singly Linked List Work?

- Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- The first node is referred to as the **head** and is responsible for holding the entire list.
- The last node points to `null`, indicating the end of the list.

### Properties of Singly Linked List:

1. Sequential Nodes: The nodes form a chain as each node points to the next.
2. Head Node: The head node holds the entire list.
3. Last Node: The last node points to null.

### Example of a singly linked list with 5 nodes:

```
Head -> [Data: 10] -> [Data: 8] -> [Data: 1] -> [Data: 11] -> [Data: 15] -> null
```
